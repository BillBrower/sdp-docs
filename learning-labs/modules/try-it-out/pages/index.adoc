== Try It Out

Welcome to the Try It Out Lab for the Solutions Delivery Platform (SDP)!

=== Overview

The purpose of this lab is to help you set up the Solutions Delivery
Platform on your own local computer so that you can try it out!

This lab will help you deploy a preconfigured Jenkins instance with SDP
configured as well as a local SonarQube instance so that you will be
able to run a sample pipeline that builds a Spring Boot application
while performing static code analysis.

The https://github.com/boozallen/sdp-labs-sample-app[sample applicationGitHub repository] represents a web application that users of SDP might
want to create a pipeline for.

=== Prerequisites

*Local Environment*:


* A text editor
* You have
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git]

* You have https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[Docker forMac] or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[Docker forWindows] installed on your machine

** For your Docker resources, you will need at least 2CPUs, 3.0GIB
Memory, and 1.0GIB Swap to ensure that everything within this guide can
run properly
** Follow the sections under the Advanced section to change the
resources you allocate to Docker depending on if you have a
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced[Windows] computer
or a https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#preferences-menu[Mac]
computer

*Skills*: The following skills would prove helpful but not needed to get
through this lab
