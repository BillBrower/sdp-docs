= JTE: Pipeline Primitives

In this lab, we're going to walk through each of the JTE pipeline
primitives and describe their usage.

== What Are Primitives

When writing reusable pipeline templates through the Jenkins Templating
Engine, one of the primary goals is to keep the template as easy to read
as humanly possible.

JTE Pipeline Primitives are defined in your pipeline configuration file
and primarily serve to aid in this endeavor by providing syntactic sugar
during the runtime execution of the template.

Throughout this lab, we will cover each of the JTE pipeline primitives
and describe when to use them and how they make writing templates even
easier.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pipeline Primitives are defined in the aggregated pipeline configuration
and make writing & reading pipeline templates easier.
