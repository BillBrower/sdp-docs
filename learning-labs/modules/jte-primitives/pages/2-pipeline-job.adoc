= Create a Pipeline Job

Before we get started, we'll need to create a Pipeline job in Jenkins
that we can play around with.

Feel free to reuse the Pipeline job created during JTE: The Basics or
follow the `same instructions<JTE The Basics Pipeline Job>` to create a
new job for this lab.

When you're finished, you should have:

*1. A pipeline template that reads:*

[source,groovy]
----
build()
static_code_analysis()
----

*2. A pipeline configuration of:*

[source,groovy]
----
libraries{
    maven
    sonarqube
}
----

[NOTE]
====
If you're reusing the same Pipeline job, your pipeline configuration may
specify the `gradle` instead of the `maven` library. Either will do for
the purposes of this lab.
====
This Pipeline job is going to be the playground within which we
learn about the different pipeline primitives for the rest of the lab.
