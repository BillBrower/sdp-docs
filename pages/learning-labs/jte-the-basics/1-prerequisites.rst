.. _JTE The Basics Prerequisites: 

-------------
Prerequisites

================
Jenkins Instance
================

A Jenkins instance will be required for this lab.  If you don't have one available to you,
we would recommend going through the :ref:`Local Development<Local Development>` learning lab 
to deploy a local Jenkins instance through Docker. 

=====================================
Ability to Create GitHub Repositories
===================================== 

When creating your first set of pipeline libraries and externalizing the pipeline configuration 
from Jenkins you will need to be able to create GitHub repositories on `github.com <https://github.com>`_.  

.. note:: 

    Theoretically, any git-based SCM provider (BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab, etc) should integrate and 
    work as expected with JTE.  For the purposes of simplifying this lab, we will be using GitHub.
