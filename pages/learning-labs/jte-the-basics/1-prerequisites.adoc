[[JTE The Basics Prerequisites]]

== Prerequisites

=== Jenkins Instance

A Jenkins instance will be required for this lab. If you don't have one
available to you, we would recommend going through the
`Local Development<Local Development>` learning lab to deploy a local
Jenkins instance through Docker.

=== Ability to Create GitHub Repositories

When creating your first set of pipeline libraries and externalizing the
pipeline configuration from Jenkins you will need to be able to create
GitHub repositories on https://github.com[github.com].

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Theoretically, any git-based SCM provider (BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab,
etc) should integrate and work as expected with JTE. For the purposes of
simplifying this lab, we will be using GitHub.
