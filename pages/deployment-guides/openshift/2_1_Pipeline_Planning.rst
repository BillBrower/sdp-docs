Section 2.1 - Pipeline Planning
===============================

=========================
Identify Your Source Code
=========================

Where are you, or your team's developers, storing their code. Ideally there's
some source code management tool (SCM) that's used to centralize, share, and
manage source code. The SDP takes advantage of these features of an SCM in your
CI/CD pipelines.

Currently, the preferred SCM is |GitHub|, which is where the SDP is putting its
source code. Other Git-based SCMS like GitLab are also viable, as are other SCMs
like Mercurial, but the SDP libraries to support them have not yet been created.
